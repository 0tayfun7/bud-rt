# Ecosystem Contributions

Welcome to the Optimism Collective Ecosystem Contributions repository. Here you'll find various different ways to contribute to the Optimism Collective so that we can build an economy that works for humans, together. 

## Contribution Buckets

Different ways to contribute to the Optimism Collective are loosely organized into "buckets" which give a sense of the relative scope, utility, and complexity of any given project. Refer to the sections below to understand what each of these buckets mean and what type of tasks or ideas you can expect to find within a bucket.

### ‚ú® Contribution Opportunities

Contribution Opportunities are concrete and tightly-scoped ways for you to contribute to the Optimism Collective ecosystem (e.g., ‚Äúreview the Bedrock smart contracts‚Äù or ‚Äúfix this specific bug‚Äù). Contribution Opportunities are generally smaller tasks and require less context so that you can get to work right away. Available opportunities might touch many different codebases within the broader Optimism ecosystem.

### üß™ Mad Science Project Ideas

Mad Science Project Ideas are ideas for projects that could work well as a fun hack or a hackathon project. Mad Science Project Ideas may not have clear immediate value for the Optimism ecosystem (yet) but act as useful explorations of novel concepts. These ideas are great for anyone looking to mess around with new tools and push the boundaries of what's possible with crypto.

### üìù Draft Project Ideas

Draft Project Ideas are ideas for projects that have value for the Optimism ecosystem but may not yet be fully understood in a manner that can be deeply specified. Here you'll find stuff that makes you think, "this would be really useful, but I'm not exactly sure how it would work in practice". Are you going to be the one to figure out how it should work?

### üî¥ Ecosystem Project Ideas

Ecosystem Project Ideas are ideas for projects that have clear value for the Optimism ecosystem and are understood well enough that they can be (mostly) fully specified. Ecosystem Project Ideas contain a concrete project task, a basic specification for what the project could look like, and a list of features that would make the project most valuable. Ecosystem Project Ideas tend to be larger than Contribution Opportunities.

### üèõÔ∏è Foundation Missions (RFPs)

Foundation Missions (aka RFPs) are proposals for specific initiatives that achieve an Optimism Collective **Intent** ‚Äî a directional goal that helps the Collective align and work together. You can think of a Foundation Mission as an arrow aiming at the target (the Intent). Just as there are many paths an arrow might take on its way to a target, there are many different Foundation Missions that might accomplish an Intent.

Foundation Missions, unlike the tasks listed in buckets, act as requests for proposals (RFPs) that teams can apply for. Generally, a limited number of teams are selected to work on a given Foundation Mission at any given time. Foundation Missions are also typically come with attached grants for the completion of the Mission.

# Foundation Missions (RFPs) 

The Optimism Collective is organized around **Intents** — directional goals that help the Collective align and work together.

Missions are proposals for specific initiatives that achieve an Intent.**  You can think of a Mission as an arrow aiming at the target (Intent).  Just as there are many paths an arrow might take on its way to the target, there are many different Missions that might accomplish an Intent. Missions are specific initiatives that can be completed start-to-finish in a given timeframe.  

There are two types of Missions:  

- **Proposed Missions**  must be submitted under an Intent. Each Intent will be equipped with its own budget. The Token House will then rank order Proposed Missions until the budget for each Intent is fully allocated. Proposed Missions enable the Governance Fund to support a broader range of initiatives aligned with our Intents.
- **Foundation Missions** are Missions that are defined by the Foundation and are akin to public Requests for Proposals for the Partner Fund. Foundation Missions must also work towards our Intents. This repository is the home for Foundation Missions (RFPs).
